2. **Action Responsiveness** - Input handling rate (> 200 actions/min)
3. **Shooting System Endurance** - Continuous shooting validation
4. **Movement System Endurance** - WASD movement validation
5. **Performance Management** - Entity count limits (< 50 enemies, < 100 bullets)
6. **Game Progression** - Score/kill tracking validation

### **Usage**
```javascript
// Keyboard shortcut
Press F7 in-game

// Manual execution
const tester = new ExtendedGameplayTester();
await tester.runExtendedTest();

// Stop test early
tester.stopTest();
```

## 📊 TESTING METHODOLOGY REVOLUTION

### **Before: False Positive Testing**
```
❌ Checked syntax but missed runtime errors
❌ Validated code structure but ignored functionality
❌ Passed tests while game was completely broken
❌ No real gameplay validation
❌ No stress testing capabilities
```

### **After: Reality-First Testing**
```
✅ Tests actual game functionality first
✅ Validates real user interactions
✅ Stress tests under extended play
✅ Monitors performance and stability
✅ Provides actionable bug reports
✅ Integrates with development workflow
```

### **Testing Philosophy: "Test Reality First"**
1. **Layer 1**: Does the game start? (CRITICAL)
2. **Layer 2**: Do core mechanics work? (MAJOR)
3. **Layer 3**: Are advanced features functional? (MINOR)
4. **Layer 4**: Is performance optimized? (POLISH)
