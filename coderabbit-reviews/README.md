# CodeRabbit Reviews (Archived)

This directory previously stored artifacts fetched by local CodeRabbit scripts. The project now uses GitHub MCP tools directly for PR triage, reviews/comments, and CI.

Status
- Archived (do not add new files here)
- Auto-review workflow remains: `.github/workflows/coderabbit-review.yml`

Use instead
- Guide: `docs/GITHUB_MCP_WORKFLOW.md`
- Quickstart: `docs/CODERABBIT_QUICKSTART.md`

If you need old history, keep this folder; otherwise it can be deleted safely.
