## Actions

### [2025-06-25] Initial autofix loop actions

#### File: scripts/powershell/setup-windows-environment.ps1
- **Line/Section**: Repair-PathIssues
- **Action**: Updated log message
- **Details**: Changed log message to accurately reflect that scripts were updated for Windows compatibility, not just "may need manual review". (CodeRabbit suggestion: incomplete path repair implementation)

- **Line/Section**: Test-PowerShellEnvironment
- **Action**: Skipped
- **Details**: Suggestion about warning severity is obsolete; code already logs error and returns false if PowerShell version is too low.

- **Line/Section**: Dynamic import check
- **Action**: Skipped
- **Details**: Suggestion about ES module support is already implemented; script checks for 'type: module' and handles missing support.

#### File: scripts/final-debugging-verification.js
- **Line/Section**: visualEffectsPath
- **Action**: Added support for VIBE_PROJECT_ROOT env var
- **Details**: Path is now configurable for better portability. (CodeRabbit suggestion: hardcoded paths)

- **Line/Section**: verifyConsoleLogging regex
- **Action**: Skipped
- **Details**: Regex already uses unicode flag; suggestion is already implemented.

#### File: scripts/powershell/optimized-conditional-profile.ps1
- **Line/Section**: Project detection pattern
- **Action**: Improved pattern matching
- **Details**: Now matches only directory boundaries using regex, reducing false positives. (CodeRabbit suggestion: pattern matching too broad)

- **Line/Section**: Dynamic function generation
- **Action**: Added security comments
- **Details**: Added comments above Invoke-Expression usages to clarify trust model and warn about code injection risk if config values ever become user-controlled.

#### File: scripts/enhanced-testing-system.js
- **Line/Section**: Bug report file write
- **Action**: Ensured directory exists before writing
- **Details**: Added fs.mkdir with { recursive: true } to prevent file write errors if directory is missing. (CodeRabbit suggestion: ensure directory exists)

- **Line/Section**: Server startup detection
- **Action**: Made detection more robust
- **Details**: Now accepts multiple indicators ('Local:', 'listening', 'ready') for server readiness. (CodeRabbit suggestion: fragile detection)

#### File: scripts/run-mcp-tests.js
- **Line/Section**: Server startup detection
- **Action**: Made detection more robust
- **Details**: Now accepts multiple indicators ('Local:', 'listening', 'ready') for server readiness. (CodeRabbit suggestion: fragile detection)

#### File: packages/core/src/GameState.js
- **Line/Section**: restart method
- **Action**: Added TODO and refactored entity reset
- **Details**: Added a TODO comment about global coupling and the need for future refactor. Extracted entity reset logic into a _resetEntities helper for maintainability. (CodeRabbit suggestions: refactor for maintainability, decouple from window globals)

#### File: scripts/run-mcp-tests.js
- **Line/Section**: Placeholder tests (lines 187+)

- **Details**: Placeholder tests are intentional for scaffolding; actual test logic will be implemented as MCP Playwright coverage expands. No action needed at this time.

- **Line/Section**: Dual test runner implementation (lines 253+)
- **Action**: Skipped
- **Details**: The dual runner structure is intentional: one runner for Playwright-based tests, one for MCPTestRunner class. This is by design for flexibility. No refactor needed at this time.
