## 3.7 Filesystem MCP Server (AI Usage Notes)

- This project uses **@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem** for all MCP file operations.
- **Access is restricted**: Only folders listed in the MCP config (`args` array) are accessible to the AI.
- **No separate settings file**: All access control is set in the main MCP config (e.g., `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, or global config).
- **For advanced config, security, or per-file/folder restrictions:** See the [official README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/filesystem/README.md).
- **AI best practice:** Always use absolute paths and operate only within allowed directories. If unsure, use the `list_allowed_directories` tool to check accessible roots.

---

## 4. Best Practices & Troubleshooting

- Prefer targeted, minimal operationsâ€”avoid full-graph or batch calls unless needed.
- Always check path requirements (absolute for MCP, relative for built-in tools).
- Use Playwright probe-driven tests for all automation.
- Regularly prune memory and keep the knowledge graph current.
- Capture artifacts (screenshots, logs) for all bug reports.
- Reference this guide and the main `.cursorrules` for standards.

---

## 5. References & Further Reading

- `.cursorrules` (core standards)
- `README.md` (architecture, file structure)
- `MCP_PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (advanced Playwright workflows)
- Official MCP documentation (for protocol details)
