### Notes (2025-08-17)

‚Ä¢ 2025-08-20 ‚Äì dots investigation underway. Added DEBUG_DOTS toggle, runtime console output for central & fragment particle counts every 30 frames, and a new Playwright probe `lingering_dots_probe` that fails on any saturated pixel after 3 s. Observations logged: dot colour matches explosion palette, flickers while shooting, shrinks/turns green when idle ‚Äì indicates overlay particle layer masking true explosion colour.

‚Ä¢ Dot artefacts persist even after `endShape` fix ‚Äì appear as single-pixel sprites that cycle magenta ‚Üî yellow every few frames; occasionally become small green dots when player stops firing. Same palette indicates the culprit is common explosion particle buffer or global `blendMode(p.ADD)` leak.

‚Ä¢ Observations 2025-08-18: - Switching bullet glow from ADD ‚Üí SCREEN eliminated tinting during active shooting, confirming additive-‚Äãblend residuals are the root cause. - Residual dots now traced to _ExplosionManager_ fragments/central-particles: tiny (<4 px) sprites with alpha <30 rendered in ADD continue to tint underlying stars. - Added guard to skip draw when `particle.size < 4 || alpha < 30`; dots frequency greatly reduced but not yet 0 ‚áí suspect another effect (visualEffects.drawEnhancedStars) still uses `p.blendMode(p.ADD)` on every frame; any 1-px star rendered after additive pass keeps colour. - Next step: move star field draw to BLEND-only layer drawn _after_ all ADD passes, or render stars to an off-screen buffer composited last.

‚Ä¢ Kill explosions currently default to magenta/yellow regardless of enemy. Need to pull palette from `enemy.bodyColor` etc. in `ExplosionManager.addKillEffect` and ensure per-particle `fragmentColor` respects that.

Action for **p2-explosion-colors**: audit `Explosion`, `EnemyFragmentExplosion` central/fragment colour assignment, verify no fall-through to fallback colours; switch to regular `p.BLEND` after additive bursts. Also search for global blend-mode leaks causing colour cycling.

### Investigation 2025-08-19 ‚Äì Magenta/Yellow Flicker & Wrong Explosion Colours

Root-cause analysis summary:

1. Residual dots are pixels rendered while the global `blendMode` was left in `p.ADD` (additive). Any later white/grey pixel then accumulates previous colour and oscillates as new additive colours appear (e.g., player muzzle flash ‚Üí yellow, grunt palette ‚Üí green).
2. Several effects still switch to additive/SCREEN blend without guaranteed reset ‚Äì notably legacy glow helpers and some background VFX functions.
3. `ExplosionManager` spawns classic `Explosion` particles only; colour-correct VFX bursts in `VisualEffectsManager` (which also trigger chromatic shift) were never hooked up, so explosions fall back to mismatched palettes.
4. `applyScreenEffects()` (chromatic aberration, bloom) is never executed because no renderer calls it.

Implemented safeguards (2025-08-19):
‚Ä¢ Added `withBlendMode(p, mode, fn)` utility ‚Äì ensures we always restore `p.BLEND`.
‚Ä¢ Refactored core glow helpers and star/particle draws to use the wrapper.
‚Ä¢ Added `ScreenEffectsRenderer` (layer OVERLAY) so chromatic shift & bloom now render once per frame.

Outstanding long-term tasks (TRACK as roadmap items):
| ID | Area | Description | Priority |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| p2-blend-safety | Render | Migrate **all** `blendMode` calls to `withBlendMode`; add ESLint/CI scan `scan:blend` to forbid raw calls. | P1 |
| p2-explosion-vfx | VFX | Route `ExplosionManager.addKillEffect` ‚ûú `visualEffectsManager.addExplosionParticles` for colour-correct bursts | P1 |
| p2-fx-rule | Dev-Rules | Add `.cursor/rules/s-blend-mode-safety-20250819-01.mdc` enforcing wrapper usage and pipeline reset | P2 |
| p2-probe-flicker | QA | Playwright probe: kill enemy, wait 120 frames, assert no additive residue (ŒîRGB < 30) | P2 |
| p2-render-api | Architecture | Formalise RenderPipeline contract: **no** renderer may call `blendMode` without wrapper; document in README | P3 |
