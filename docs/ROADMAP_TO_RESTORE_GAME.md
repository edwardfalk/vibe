# VIBE Game Restoration Roadmap

## Debugging & Unblocking Playwright/Probe Integration
**Goal:** Ensure Playwright tests can reliably load and execute probe runner modules in the browser context.

### Subtasks
- [x] Verified dev server serves probe runner at the expected URL.
  - [x] Confirmed URL accessible in Playwright context.
  - [x] Dev server config confirmed; no adjustments needed.
- [x] Correct dynamic import path validated (`/packages/...`).
  - [x] Absolute path `/packages/...` confirmed working; relative path not required.
  - [x] Added error logging in `page.evaluate` (now clean).
- [x] Direct import works; fallback not required:
  - [x] `probeRunner` is now automatically attached to `window`.
  - [x] Test-only entry point no longer necessary.
- [x] Validated `window.probeRunner` availability and functionality in Playwright.
  - [x] Added Playwright test assertions confirming presence and healthy result.
- [x] Comprehensive probe re-run via Playwright; all systems reported healthy.
- [x] Documented working solution and updated Playwright setup guidelines.

**Done Criteria:**
- Playwright tests can dynamically load and execute probe runner modules in the browser context.
- No more import or undefined errors in probe-driven Playwright tests.
- Roadmap and documentation updated with the solution.

## Executive Summary

The game has been methodically restored and validated through a series of critical fixes and probe-driven tests. Major architectural, migration, and integration issues have been addressed. The roadmap below reflects all completed and in-progress work as of now.

## ⚠️ Automated Validation Results (2025-06-27)

- Manual gameplay validation: **FAILED**
  - No enemies spawn, graphics are buggy, most core gameplay is broken.
  - Indicates critical architectural or migration regressions remain.
- Automated bug-report artifact handling: **PASS**
  - Dummy and real bug report files are moved correctly, even cross-drive.
- Playwright/MCP probes: **Pending full diagnostic run**

**Next Priority:**
1. Run all Playwright/MCP probes and collect results (automated diagnostics)
2. Move Phase 4 (Refactor, Cleanup, and Technical Debt) up in priority to address likely architectural/codebase issues before performance or new features.

## Phase 1: Critical Functionality & Architecture
**Goal:** Restore all core systems, eliminate migration artifacts, and ensure all critical gameplay features are operational.

### Subtasks

- [x] Audit and fix all migration artifacts (old `/js` references, broken imports, etc.)
  - [x] Search for and remove all `/js` references
  - [x] Update all broken import paths
  - [x] Validate all modules are loaded correctly
- [x] Restore all core gameplay systems:
  - [x] Player movement and controls
  - [x] Enemy spawning and AI

  - [x] Audio system (music, SFX)
  - [x] UI rendering (score, health, etc.)
- [x] Fix Grunt knockback bug (now passes probe)
- [x] Restore and validate Playwright probes:
  - [x] Tank Armor Break Probe (passes)
  - [x] Grunt Knockback Probe (passes)
  - [x] AI Liveness Probe (passes)
  - [x] Collision Detection Probe (logic and import path fixed, passes)

- No broken imports or legacy references remain.
- Documentation accurately reflects the current architecture.
- All Playwright probes pass.

**Test/Validation Checkpoint:**

  - [x] Fix undefined `window.bullets` crash in GameLoop (added global initialization)
  - [ ] Play through core loop (start, play, win/lose, restart)
  - [ ] Verify UI updates (score, health, etc.)
  - [ ] Test audio activation and playback
- [x] Ticketing system end-to-end test
  - [x] Create ticket via API (Playwright probe)

## Phase X: Dev Server Port Management & Launch Reliability
**Goal:** Ensure the dev server (Five-Server) and Ticket-API always start on their canonical ports (5500 / 3001), never double-start, and expose simple start / stop / status commands that Just Work™ in both interactive dev sessions and automated Playwright/MCP runs.

### Strategy Overview
1. **Unify Port Config** – Single source of truth (`DEV_SERVER_PORT`, `TICKET_API_PORT`) in `config.js` (read by all scripts).
2. **Robust Port Utilities** – New helper `scripts/port-utils.js` with cross-platform functions:
   * `getProcessOnPort(port)` – return `{pid, cmdLine}` or `null`.
   * `isExpectedProcess(cmdLine, expect)` – fuzzy match helper.
   * `freePort(port, expect)` – kill if stray.
   * `waitForHttp(url, timeoutMs)` – reused by orchestrator & probes.
3. **Standardised Bun Scripts**
   * `bun run dev:start` – idempotent start (reuse if healthy, else launch)
   * `bun run dev:stop` – graceful stop for both servers
   * `bun run dev:status` – human-readable status table
   * `bun run dev:restart` – convenience alias (stop ➜ start)
4. **Refactor `scripts/test-orchestrator.js`**
   * Replace its bespoke port logic with the new utilities
   * Respect `--no-server` flag for CI containers that already have server running
5. **Background Friendly** – All start scripts must:  
   * print `READY` line when HTTP HEAD passes  
   * exit with non-zero if health-check fails within 15 s  
   * trap SIGINT/SIGTERM and cleanly shut down child processes
6. **PowerShell Helpers** – Optional PS script `tools/dev-server.ps1` providing the same commands for manual PowerShell users (calls JS scripts under the hood).
7. **Playwright Probe** – New quick probe `startup-dev-server-probe.test.js` that asserts Five-Server HTML response != blank & status 200.
8. **Docs & Troubleshooting** – Update README + add `docs/DEV_SERVER_WORKFLOW.md` with:
   * Quick-start (`bun run dev:start`)  
   * Status & common errors  
   * "Port already in use" decision tree  
   * FAQ for CI / GitHub Actions.

### Detailed Task Breakdown
- [ ] **X-1** Create `scripts/port-utils.js` (see Strategy 2)
- [ ] **X-2** Add `DEV_SERVER_PORT` & `TICKET_API_PORT` constants to `packages/core/src/config.js` (export + use everywhere)
- [ ] **X-3** Update `package.json` scripts section:  
      - `"dev:start"`  
      - `"dev:stop"`  
      - `"dev:status"`  
      - `"dev:restart"`
- [ ] **X-4** Migrate existing `serve`, `dev`, `predev` scripts to use new utilities; deprecate legacy script combo.
- [ ] **X-5** Refactor `scripts/test-orchestrator.js` to import port-utils and remove duplicate code.
- [ ] **X-6** Write Playwright probe `tests/startup-dev-server-probe.test.js` (quick HEAD check).
- [ ] **X-7** Add CI step in GitHub Actions to run `bun run dev:start && bun run dev:status`.
- [ ] **X-8** Create `docs/DEV_SERVER_WORKFLOW.md` with full instructions.
- [ ] **X-9** Manual QA:  
      - Run `dev:start`, check READY line.  
      - Attempt second `dev:start` (should reuse).  
      - Kill stray process manually and run `dev:status` (should show *stopped*).  
      - Run `dev:restart` (should succeed).  
      - Verify Playwright suite passes using new logic.
- [ ] **X-10** Update roadmap, README, and `.cursorrules` references to new commands.

**Done Criteria (expanded):**
- Running `bun run dev:start` from a clean shell consistently shows READY within 5-10 s.
- Running the same command again detects healthy server and exits with code 0 (no duplicate).
- Attempting to run Five-Server manually on 5500 while the dev script is up yields a clear error and non-zero exit.
- `bun run test:orchestrated` succeeds without port conflicts.
- Documentation & scripts lint-clean; Playwright startup probe passes.

**Test/Validation Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Automated: `startup-dev-server-probe` passes.  
- [ ] Manual: Run start / stop / status sequence 5× in a row without failure.
- [ ] CI: GitHub Action matrix (Node 20 + Bun 1.*) completes all jobs green.
