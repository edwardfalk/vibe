# Modular Ticketing & Workflow Platform Vision

## Purpose

A robust, modular, automation-first ticketing and workflow platform for modern development teams. Designed to be project-agnostic, scalable, and deeply integrable with code, automation, and AI.

---

## 1. Problems with Text Document (JSON) Ticketing

- Manual file management is error-prone (naming, folder structure, collisions).
- No real-time collaboration—no locking, no live updates, risk of merge conflicts.
- Querying and reporting are slow and limited (grep, search, not SQL).
- Automation is harder—scripts must parse files, handle edge cases, and can’t easily do complex queries (e.g., “all open tasks assigned to X, tagged Y, created last week”).
- Scaling is limited—hundreds or thousands of tickets become unwieldy.

---

## 2. What Would Be Better?

### A. Database-Backed Ticketing (SQL or NoSQL)

- Centralized, robust, and fast.
- Atomic operations (no partial writes).
- Rich queries (filter, sort, aggregate, join).
- Easy to build APIs/UI for both humans and automation.
- Can be cloud-hosted (Postgres, MongoDB, etc.) or local (SQLite for dev).

### B. Modern Web UI/UX

- Single-page app (React, Svelte, etc.) for ticket management.
- Real-time updates (WebSockets, polling, etc.).
- Bulk actions, drag-and-drop, Kanban, etc.
- Rich artifact management (screenshots, logs, attachments).

### C. API-First, Automation-Ready

- REST or GraphQL API for all ticket operations.
- Webhooks/events for automation triggers (e.g., “on ticket closed, run X”).
- CLI tools for power users and scripts.

### D. Integration with Code/DevOps

- Link tickets to commits, branches, PRs.
- Auto-create tickets from test failures, logs, or probe results.
- Export/import to/from GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, etc.

### E. MCP-Style Extensibility

- Plugin system for custom workflows, automations, or integrations.
- Memory graph for relationships between tickets, code, and entities.

## 3. How to Get There?

### Option 1: Use an Existing Open Source Solution

- OpenProject, Taiga, Focalboard, Plane, etc.
- Self-hosted, API-rich, extensible, and can be themed or integrated.
- Pros: Fast to set up, proven, lots of features.
- Cons: May require adapting workflows, less “bespoke” than a custom system.

### Option 2: Build a Custom MCP Ticketing Server

- Node.js/Express + SQLite/Postgres for backend.
- Expose REST/GraphQL API for all ticket operations.
- Frontend: React/Svelte/Vue SPA, or even TUI (terminal UI) for power users.
- Artifacts: Store in S3, local disk, or as BLOBs in DB.
- MCP Integration: Expose as a new MCP toolset (e.g., `mcp_ticket_create`, `mcp_ticket_query`, etc.).
- Pros: Tailored to your needs, can evolve with the project, deep automation.
- Cons: More upfront work, must maintain.

### Option 3: Hybrid (GitHub Issues + Local Sync)

- Use GitHub Issues/Projects for tickets, sync to local DB for offline/automation.
- Pros: Leverage GitHub’s ecosystem, easy linking to code.
- Cons: Requires sync logic, may not be as fast for local-only workflows.

## 4. “Think Big” Vision: The Modular DevOps Platform

- Unified dashboard for tickets, code, tests, and memory graph.
- Real-time, multi-user, automation-first.
- AI-native: Tickets can be created, triaged, and updated by AI or humans.
- Extensible: Plugins for new workflows, integrations, or visualizations.
- Portable: Can run locally (SQLite) or scale to cloud (Postgres, S3, etc.).
- Open API: Everything scriptable, automatable, and observable.

## 5. Summary Table

| Approach         | Stability | Automation | Scalability | Dev Effort | Flexibility | Best For               |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Text/JSON files  | Low       | Medium     | Low         | Low        | Medium      | Small, simple projects |
| SQL/NoSQL DB     | High      | High       | High        | Medium     | High        | Growing, modular teams |
| Open Source Tool | High      | High       | High        | Low-Med    | Medium      | Fast setup, proven     |
| Custom MCP       | Highest   | Highest    | Highest     | High       | Highest     | Bespoke, future-proof  |

## 6. Recommendation

- For modular, automation-heavy projects: Move to a database-backed, API-first ticketing system (custom or open source), with a modern UI and deep automation hooks.
- Short-term: Keep JSON for bootstrapping, but design the new system in parallel.
- Long-term: Build or adopt a robust, extensible platform—think “Modular DevOps” with AI, automation, and memory graph at its core.

---

## 7. Next Steps

- Draft requirements and user stories for the platform.
- Evaluate open source options and their extensibility.
- Prototype a minimal custom MCP ticketing server and API.
- Design a plugin system for workflow and integration extensibility.
- Plan for cross-project, multi-tenant support.
