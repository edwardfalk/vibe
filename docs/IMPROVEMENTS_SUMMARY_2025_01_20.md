# Game Improvements Summary - 2025-01-20

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. Bigger Kill Explosion Particles
**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
- **Fragment Sizes:** Increased from `size * 0.4-1.2` to `size * 0.6-1.5` for bigger, more visible fragments
- **Central Explosion Particles:** Increased from `size 12-30` to `size 16-40` for fuller explosions  
- **Fragment Count:** Increased grunt fragments from 18 to 24, other enemies from 12 to 15
- **Central Particle Count:** Increased grunt central particles from 30 to 40, others from 20 to 25

**Impact:** Kill explosions now feel much fuller and more satisfying, especially for grunts

### 2. Improved Player & Grunt Visuals
**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
- **Grunt Front Direction:** Added nose/snout and small mouth to clearly show which way grunt is facing
- **Visual Clarity:** Small directional indicators make it easier to see grunt orientation

**Impact:** Players can now clearly see which direction grunts are facing during combat

### 3. Fixed Background Stripes
**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
- **Gradient Resolution:** Increased from 8 steps to 120 steps for smooth gradient
- **Stripe Elimination:** High-resolution gradient eliminates thick horizontal color bands
- **Reduced Animation:** Slightly reduced time-based color variations for cleaner look

**Impact:** Background now has smooth cosmic gradient without distracting horizontal stripes

### 4. Restored Stabber Speech & Sounds
**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
- **Fixed Speech Trigger:** Added 40% chance for Stabber to speak when making ambient sounds
- **Speech Integration:** Connected ambient sound system with speech system
- **Sound Verification:** Confirmed stabberChant and stabberStalk sounds are properly configured

**Impact:** Stabbers now speak their lines ("STAB TIME!", "SLICE AND DICE!", etc.) in addition to making sounds

### 5. Reduced Grunt Ambient Noise
**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
- **Volume Reduction:** Reduced all grunt ambient volumes by ~25-30%
  - gruntMalfunction: 0.12 → 0.08
  - gruntBeep: 0.08 → 0.05  
  - gruntWhir: 0.1 → 0.07
  - gruntError: 0.1 → 0.07
  - gruntGlitch: 0.09 → 0.06
- **Reverb Reduction:** Further reduced reverb intensity from 10-20% to 6-14%
- **Muffling:** Added special lowpass filter capping grunt ambient at 800Hz for muffle effect

**Impact:** Grunt ambient sounds are now less annoying while maintaining atmospheric character

## Files Modified
