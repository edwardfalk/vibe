# Documentation & Rule Audit Plan

> Purpose: Central tracker for the end-to-end review, correction, and cleanup of **all** documentation and rule files in the Vibe project.  This file will be updated as each section is audited.

---

## 1. Audit Process

1. **Inventory** ‚Äì Enumerate every Markdown / MDC rule file in the repo.
2. **Classify** ‚Äì Mark each as *‚úÖ accurate*, *‚ö†Ô∏è needs update*, or *üóëÔ∏è obsolete*.
3. **Correct / Archive / Delete** ‚Äì
   - Fix inaccurate content immediately if straightforward.
   - Archive to `docs/archive/` if <80 % sure it is obsolete.
   - Delete outright if ‚â•80 % sure it is obsolete.
4. **Cross-link & Consistency** ‚Äì Ensure internal links, file names, and code references are current.
5. **Validation** ‚Äì Run link checker + grep search to confirm no dangling references.
6. **Summary** ‚Äì Provide aggregated change log upon completion.

## 2. Document Inventory (initial)

| Path | Category | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `.cursorrules` | Core Rule | ‚úÖ (updated) |
| `README.md` | Root Doc | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/PROJECT_VISION.md` | Vision | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/DESIGN.md` | Design | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/TICKETING_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` | Workflow | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/MCP_PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_GUIDE.md` | Testing | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/MCP_TOOLS_GUIDE.md` | Tools | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/AUDIO_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` | Audio | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/CODERABBIT_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` | CodeRabbit | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/GAMEPLAY_TESTING_GUIDE.md` | Testing | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/POWERSHELL_ISSUES_GUIDE.md` | Environment | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/POWERSHELL_ISSUES_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Environment | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/explosions_fx_next_steps.md` | Feature Notes | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/PROJECT_CLEANUP_2025-01-09.md` | Historical | üóëÔ∏è (deleted) |
| `docs/debugging/*` | Debugging | ‚úÖ |
| `docs/archive/*` | Archived | üîç (confirm archive) |
| `.cursor/rules/*` | Rules | üîç (needs targeted rule-by-rule review) |

> **Legend**
> *‚úÖ accurate* ‚Äì No action needed  
> *‚ö†Ô∏è needs update* ‚Äì Review & correct  
> *üóëÔ∏è obsolete* ‚Äì Delete (‚â•80 % confidence)  
> *üîç confirm archive* ‚Äì Already archived; verify we don't still need it.

## 3. Priority Order

1. `.cursorrules` ‚Äì single source of truth.
2. Root `README.md` ‚Äì high-visibility entry point.
3. Critical workflow guides ‚Äì Ticketing, Testing, MCP Tools.
4. Remaining docs in `docs/`.
5. Rule files in `.cursor/rules/`.
6. Archived docs ‚Äì clean up if safe.

---

## 4. Immediate Next Steps

- [x] Audit `.cursorrules` for outdated references (e.g., module lists, probe policy).
- [x] Cross-check README architecture section with actual `packages/` contents.
- [x] Validate ticketing API guide vs. current server code (`packages/api/`).
- [x] Confirm MCP Playwright workflow aligns with `tests/*` probes.
- [x] Delete obsolete cleanup summary doc.
- [x] Implemented link checker script (`bun run docs:check-links`).
- [x] Rule-by-rule quick pass of `.cursor/rules` files complete.
- [x] Archive folder verified (no active docs).

### Probe-Only Testing Policy ‚Äì Rationale
Probe scripts embed domain-specific diagnostics and automatically file tickets with artifacts.  Generic "describe/it" style specs duplicate effort and go stale quickly when the game evolves.  Enforcing probe-only tests guarantees:
1. **Lower maintenance overhead** ‚Äì One authoritative test per subsystem.
2. **Self-healing automation** ‚Äì Probes auto-restart, capture screenshots, and integrate with ticketing.
3. **Better signal** ‚Äì Probes perform deep game-context checks instead of UI-agnostic assertions.
4. **Consistency** ‚Äì Aligns with MCP tooling that expects the *-probe.test.js naming pattern for analytics.
