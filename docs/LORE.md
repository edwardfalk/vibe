# Vibe – Game Lore & Tone

This document collects the flavour text, dark humour, and bizarre character descriptions that set Vibe’s tone. It is **non-technical** and intentionally colourful.

## Enemies

- **Grunt** – Whiny baby-bots that complain about Wi-Fi passwords while trying to shoot you.
- **Stabber** – Eerie assassin creatures with distorted, screeching “laser beaks” that strike on beat 3.5.
- **Rusher** – Maniacal zealots that rush in and detonate as close to the player as possible.
- **Tank** – Giant armoured brutes that fire plasma balls and, when destroyed, collapse into radioactive plasma clouds. One really bad cloud when killed with bullets, and an even worse when blown up with the time bomb. If you dare run to it and make contact you will place the bomb automatically.

## Player

A mad anti-hero wielding rapid-fire hi-hat blasters. Future power-ups (e.g., a shotgun with on-beat damage bonuses) are planned but **not** part of v1.0.

## World Tone

Expect irreverent humour, unexpected taunts, and emergent musical chaos. If it isn’t weird or rhythmic, it probably doesn’t belong.
