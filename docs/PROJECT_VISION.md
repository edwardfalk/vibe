# Vibe Project Vision

## Purpose
Vibe is a bizarre, half-mad, rhythm-driven space shooter where every action is synced to the cosmic beat. The goal: deliver a wild, energetic, and musically-charged gameplay experience that's as fun to build as it is to play.

## Core Design Pillars
- **Cosmic Beat System:** The game world pulses to a universal rhythm. Enemies, bullets, and even the UI dance to the beat. If it doesn't groove, it doesn't ship.
- **Modular Mayhem:** Every system is a module. Want to swap out the enemy AI for a disco-dancing octopus? Go for it. Modularity means chaos is always under control.
- **Automation & AI:** We automate everything that isn't fun. Ticketing, bug reports, and even some game content are managed by scripts and AI—so humans can focus on the madness.
- **Accessibility & Extensibility:** Anyone can jump in, mod, or extend the game. The codebase is clean, documented, and ready for new ideas (or new forms of weirdness).

## Player Experience
- **Beat-Synced Action:** Fast, responsive gameplay where every move, shot, and explosion is tied to the cosmic rhythm.
- **Bizarre & Funny:** Expect the unexpected. Enemies might taunt you, the UI might break into song, and the game will never take itself too seriously.
- **Replayable Chaos:** Modular systems and AI-driven content mean no two playthroughs are the same. The only constant is the beat.

## Development Philosophy
- **Strict Modularity:** No monoliths, no spaghetti. Every feature is a module, every bug is a ticket, every improvement is tracked.
- **Automation for Sanity:** Ticketing, testing, and memory management are automated to keep the focus on fun and creativity.
- **Ticketing Serves the Game:** The ticketing system isn't just for chores—it's the backbone that keeps the madness running smoothly. See [TICKETING_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md](mdc:docs/TICKETING_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md) for the current workflow vision.
- **Continuous Improvement:** We're always tuning, tweaking, and adding new forms of weirdness. If it makes the game funnier, stranger, or more musical, it's worth doing.

Vibe is a cosmic jam session where code, music, and madness collide. If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong.
