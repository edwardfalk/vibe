## Known Dev Server Issue (to fix later)

- Observed 404 on `/` and 403 on `/index.html` when serving with Five Server on port 5500.
- Likely cause: Five Server root/SPA/static path rules, not Bun‚Äôs built-in server.
- Current workaround: let Playwright manage the server during tests (webServer in `playwright.config.js`).
- To do: standardize on a single root (`.` or `/public`) and adjust Five Server flags; avoid loading from `/node_modules` at runtime.

## Migration Progress Summary (2025-08-15)

- Split Game Loop (üöß In Progress)

  - Core wrapper: `packages/game/src/core/GameLoopCore.js` ‚Äì instance-mode p5, deterministic seed, calls legacy `setup/draw` via imports.
  - Init extraction: `packages/game/src/core/SetupPhases.js` ‚Äì systems initialization after `setup`.
  - Per-frame orchestration: `packages/game/src/core/UpdateLoop.js` ‚Äì calls legacy `updateGame/drawGame`, wraps profiler/LOD.
  - Combat ops: `packages/game/src/core/CombatOps.js` ‚Äì bullets, bombs, collisions.
  - Enemy ops: `packages/game/src/core/EnemyOps.js` ‚Äì enemy updates, stabber handling, explosion area-damage.
  - Legacy exports: `packages/game/src/GameLoop.js` now exports `updateGame/drawGame`; seed guard added.

- Bootstrap/Dev glue (‚úÖ Completed)

  - Input flags + listeners centralized in `packages/systems/src/InputSystem.js` via `packages/game/src/bootstrap/InputBootstrap.js`.
  - Audio/canvas unlock moved to `packages/game/src/bootstrap/AudioCanvasUnlock.js`.
  - Profiler shortcut + single-action UI keys routed in `packages/game/src/dev/DevShortcuts.js`.
  - Minimal in-page test API: `packages/game/src/dev/TestRunner.js` (used by probes).

- Tests & probes (‚úÖ Completed)

  - Replaced legacy `/js/ai-liveness-probe.js` with `packages/tooling/src/probes/livenessProbe.js`.
  - Playwright config standardized to port 5500; webServer manages Five Server during tests.

- Docs & scripts (‚úÖ Completed)
  - Updated: `README.md`, `docs/MCP_PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `docs/GAMEPLAY_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/CURSOR_RULES_GUIDE.md`.
  - `package.json`: removed legacy `js/**` lint/watch, deprecated ticket scripts, normalized serve/test scripts.
  - Removed unused global: `speechManager`.

## Next Steps (planned)

- Continue "split-gameloop": extract remaining draw ordering hooks and tighten `GameLoop.js` to a thin orchestrator.
- Stabilize Five Server root policy (choose `.` vs `/public`) and update serve/Playwright flags accordingly.
- Run math consistency scan and replace stray raw math/p5 references with `@vibe/core/mathUtils` where applicable.
