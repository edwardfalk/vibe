## Dev-Server Issue (still open)

- Observed 404 on `/` and 403 on `/index.html` when serving with Five Server on port 5500.
- Likely cause: Five Server root/SPA/static path rules, not Bun‚Äôs built-in server.
- Current workaround: let Playwright manage the server during tests (webServer in `playwright.config.js`).
- To do: standardize on a single root (`.` or `/public`) and adjust Five Server flags; avoid loading from `/node_modules` at runtime.

## Migration Progress Summary (2025-08-16)

- Split Game Loop (‚úÖ Completed)

  - Core wrapper: `packages/game/src/core/GameLoopCore.js` ‚Äì instance-mode p5, deterministic seed, calls legacy `setup/draw` via imports.
  - Init extraction: `packages/game/src/core/SetupPhases.js` ‚Äì systems initialization after `setup`.
  - Per-frame orchestration: `packages/game/src/core/UpdateLoop.js` ‚Äì calls legacy `updateGame/drawGame`, wraps profiler/LOD.
  - Combat ops: `packages/game/src/core/CombatOps.js` ‚Äì bullets, bombs, collisions.
  - Enemy ops: `packages/game/src/core/EnemyOps.js` ‚Äì enemy updates, stabber handling, explosion area-damage.
  - Legacy exports: `packages/game/src/GameLoop.js` now exports `updateGame/drawGame`; seed guard added.

- Bootstrap/Dev glue (‚úÖ Completed)

  - Input flags + listeners centralized in `packages/systems/src/InputSystem.js` via `packages/game/src/bootstrap/InputBootstrap.js`.
  - Audio/canvas unlock moved to `packages/game/src/bootstrap/AudioCanvasUnlock.js`.
  - Profiler shortcut + single-action UI keys routed in `packages/game/src/dev/DevShortcuts.js`.
  - Minimal in-page test API: `packages/game/src/dev/TestRunner.js` (used by probes).

- Tests & probes (‚úÖ Completed)

  - Replaced legacy `/js/ai-liveness-probe.js` with `packages/tooling/src/probes/livenessProbe.js`.
  - Playwright config standardized to port 5500; webServer manages Five Server during tests.

- Docs & scripts (‚úÖ Completed)

### 2025-08-16 Additional Notes

- Implemented core update & draw pipelines (`CoreUpdate.js`, `CoreDraw.js`) and set as default.
- All entity/bullet arrays now live inside `GameState`; window globals removed.
- Added `scripts/scan/scan-math.js` (now with baseline + allow-list & strict mode) and npm script `scan:math`. Math-consistency enforcement active in CI.
- Legacy `GameLoop.updateGame/drawGame` reduced to thin wrappers.

#### Known Issues (2025-08-17)

1. Enemies leave pixel artifacts (‚Äúdots‚Äù) on background after death; investigate VFX cleanup.
2. Level indicator UI disappeared after renderer split; restore in `HudRenderer` (planned).
3. Death-transition shader: replace overlay tint with proper DesaturateShader & vignette.

## Phase 2 Backlog (moved to docs/ROADMAP_PHASE2.md)

This backlog has been relocated. See `docs/ROADMAP_PHASE2.md` for the living list.
