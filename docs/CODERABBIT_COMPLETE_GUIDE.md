# CodeRabbit – Working Guide (2025-08)

## 🎯 Overview

This is the complete guide for CodeRabbit integration in the Vibe project. It covers everything from setup to advanced workflows, including the enhanced deduplication system that prevents duplicate tickets.

5. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
6. [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage)

## What triggers reviews

- CodeRabbit reviews Pull Requests targeting the default branch (current default: `main`).
- Auto-reviews are skipped for non-default target branches (e.g., `unstable`) unless enabled in CodeRabbit settings.
- Manual triggers via PR comment:
  - `@coderabbitai review` (incremental)
  - `@coderabbitai full review` (full)

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Ensure environment is configured
bun run validate-env

# 2. Run initial analysis
bun run coderabbit:fetch-complete
bun run coderabbit:analyze

# 3. Create tickets (with deduplication)
bun run coderabbit:workflow
```

## 🛡️ Deduplication System

### How It Works

The enhanced deduplication system prevents creating duplicate tickets using a **multi-level approach**:

#### Level 1: Hash-Based Tracking
```javascript
// Each suggestion gets a unique hash
generateSuggestionHash(suggestion) {
  const key = `${suggestion.prNumber}-${suggestion.category}-${suggestion.text.substring(0, 100)}`;
  return Buffer.from(key).toString('base64').replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').substring(0, 32);
}
```

#### Level 2: Existing Ticket Analysis
- Checks same PR number
- Compares categories
- Verifies ticket status (not closed/resolved)

#### Level 3: Text Similarity
- 80% similarity threshold using word overlap
- Prevents near-duplicate tickets

### Persistent Tracking

Processed suggestions are stored in `tests/bug-reports/processed-coderabbit-suggestions.json`:

```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "2025-06-09T00:41:22.874Z",
  "suggestions": [
    "dW5kZWZpbmVkLWJ1Zy1bZXJyb3JdIDI5",
    "dW5kZWZpbmVkLWJ1Zy1bZXJyb3JdIDMw"
  ]
}
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check processed suggestions count
cat tests/bug-reports/processed-coderabbit-suggestions.json | jq '.suggestions | length'

# Verify no duplicates in tickets
grep -h "coderabbitSuggestion" tests/bug-reports/CR-*.json | sort | uniq -d
```

## Minimal daily workflow

1. Open PRs to `main` (or enable auto-reviews for `unstable` in CodeRabbit settings).
2. Fetch reviews locally:
   ```bash
   bun run coderabbit:fetch-latest
   ```
   - Outputs `coderabbit-reviews/latest.json` and `coderabbit-reviews/actionable-summary.json`.
3. Fix from `actionable-summary.json`; commit.

Optional history-aware:
```bash
bun run coderabbit:fetch-new
```

## 🔄 Workflow Commands

### Core Workflow Scripts

| Command | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `coderabbit:cycle` | Complete end-to-end workflow | **Recommended for regular use** |
| `coderabbit:workflow` | Resolve outdated + create new tickets | When you have fresh analysis data |
| `coderabbit:resolve-outdated` | Only resolve outdated tickets | Cleanup existing tickets |
| `coderabbit:auto-tickets` | Only create new tickets | When you want just ticket creation |

### Scripts we keep

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `coderabbit:fetch-latest` | Snapshot + actionable summary |
| `coderabbit:fetch-new` | History-aware (optional) |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required (Windows)
set GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# macOS/Linux
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

### Deduplication Settings

#### Similarity Threshold
```javascript
// In coderabbit-auto-tickets.js
const similarText = this.calculateTextSimilarity(text1, text2) > 0.8; // 80%
```

#### Age Thresholds
```javascript
// Stale ticket resolution (30 days)
const thirtyDays = 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

// Priority escalation (7 days for performance issues)
if (category === 'performance' && daysSinceCreated > 7) {
  return 'high';
}
```

## Notes & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Duplicate Tickets Still Created
**Solutions:**
1. Check if suggestion text varies significantly
2. Verify hash generation is consistent
3. Review similarity threshold (may need adjustment)

#### Valid Tickets Resolved
**Solutions:**
1. Check if PR is still in latest analysis
2. Verify suggestion text matching logic
3. Review age-based resolution criteria

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test individual components
node -e "import('./coderabbit-auto-tickets.js').then(m => console.log('✅ Auto-tickets loaded'))"

# Check file permissions
ls -la tests/bug-reports/processed-coderabbit-suggestions.json

# Validate JSON structure
cat tests/bug-reports/processed-coderabbit-suggestions.json | jq '.'
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Integration with CI/CD

#### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
name: CodeRabbit Ticket Management
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # Daily at 9 AM

jobs:
  manage-tickets:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run coderabbit:cycle
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## 📊 Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance
1. **Daily**: Run `coderabbit:cycle` after PR merges
2. **Weekly**: Review resolved tickets for accuracy
3. **Monthly**: Archive old processed suggestions
4. **Quarterly**: Audit deduplication effectiveness

### Quality Assurance
1. **Spot Check**: Manually verify 10% of resolved tickets
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust similarity threshold based on false positives
3. **Category Review**: Ensure proper categorization of suggestions
