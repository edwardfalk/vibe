## 🔧 Major Fixes Implemented

### 1. Game Startup Resolution
**Problem**: Game wasn't initializing - no canvas, no game systems
**Solution**: 
- Uncommented `BaseEnemy.js` and `bullet.js` in index.html
- Fixed missing module dependencies
- Resolved import chain issues

**Result**: Game now starts successfully with all systems operational

### 2. Test Suite Crash Prevention
**Problem**: `testSoundSystem` and `testAdvancedGameplay` methods missing
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive `testSoundSystem` method with audio validation
- Added `testAdvancedGameplay` with 5 sub-tests:
  - Player dash mechanics testing
  - Enemy special abilities validation
  - Complex collision scenarios
  - Performance stress testing
  - Beat synchronization accuracy

**Result**: Test suite executes completely without crashes

### 3. Enhanced Documentation & Structure
**Improvements**:
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all test methods
- Standardized test result object structure
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Clear test descriptions and validation criteria

## 🎮 Game System Health Status

### ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Game Loop**: Running smoothly at stable frame rate
- **Player System**: All movement and controls working
- **Audio System**: Fully initialized with all required methods
- **Game State**: Valid and properly managed
- **Camera System**: Working with proper positioning
- **Enemy System**: 2 enemies active and behaving correctly

### ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION
- **Shooting System**: Bullets not being created on player input
- **Collision Detection**: Missing core collision methods
- **AI Liveness Probe**: Execution failing (may be import issue)
- **Beat Clock**: Missing some required methods
- **UI Renderer**: Missing render method

### 🔍 IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSES

#### Shooting System Issues
- Player shooting input not triggering bullet creation
- Possible mouse event handling or bullet factory issue
- All supporting systems (audio, rate limiting) working correctly

#### Collision System Gaps
- Missing methods: `checkPlayerBulletCollisions`, `checkEnemyBulletCollisions`, `checkPlayerEnemyCollisions`
- May need to implement these methods in CollisionSystem.js

#### AI Liveness Probe Failures
- Import/execution issues with ai-liveness-probe.js
- May be related to module loading or async execution
