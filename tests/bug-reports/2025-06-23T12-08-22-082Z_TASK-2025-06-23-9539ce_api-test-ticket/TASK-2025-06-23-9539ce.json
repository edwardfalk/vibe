Concluded the issue is a probable bug in the `bun` runtime on Windows suppressing stdout for the CLI script. The CLI `list` command is currently unreliable in this environment."

      "action": "Confirmed CLI stdout bug is not easily solvable. The recommended alternative is to query the ticket API server directly. For example, using httpie: `http GET http://localhost:3001/tickets status==open`. This provides a reliable way to get ticket data. The underlying ticket logic and API are sound."
