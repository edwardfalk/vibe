The platform should support database-backed storage, modern web UI, API-first automation, DevOps/code integration, plugin extensibility, and memory graph features. Reference and iterate on the vision document at docs/vision/modular_ticketing_platform_vision.md. This is intended for use beyond Vibe and should be architected for reuse across projects.",
