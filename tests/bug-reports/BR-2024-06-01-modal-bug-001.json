  "type": "bug",
  "description": "After submitting a bug report via the modal, the modal does not close even though the ticket is created and the backend responds. The modal should set its status to 'success' and close after a short delay, but it remains open. This affects both manual and automated (AI/Playwright) workflows.",

      "details": "Fixed modal closing issue by: 1) Corrected API endpoint in ticketManager.js to use port 3001, 2) Added better error handling with auto-close after 3 seconds on error, 3) Improved logging for debugging. Modal now closes properly on both success and error cases."
