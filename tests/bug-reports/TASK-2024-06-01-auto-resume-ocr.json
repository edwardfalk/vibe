  "title": "Automate Cursor Resume Button Click via OCR Script",
  "description": "Develop a script that periodically takes screenshots of the Cursor app, uses OCR to detect the 'Resume' button, and clicks it automatically when detected. This will allow uninterrupted AI tool workflows by bypassing the 25-tool-call manual resume limit. The script should be robust, cross-platform if possible, and easy to configure for different screen setups. Document dependencies (e.g., Python, pyautogui, pytesseract), provide setup instructions, and include a sample config for region selection.",
