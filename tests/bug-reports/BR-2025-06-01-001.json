  "type": "bug",
  "description": "Creating a file in tests/bug-reports/ works, but deletion via the available tool fails with 'file not found' even when the file exists. This blocks automated cleanup and may indicate a deeper issue with file operations in the environment. Steps to reproduce: 1) Create a file in tests/bug-reports/. 2) Attempt to delete it using the tool. 3) Observe failure. Expected: File is deleted. Actual: Tool reports file not found.",

Deletion with a relative path works as expected. Solution: Always use relative paths with delete_file, and absolute paths with MCP commands."
