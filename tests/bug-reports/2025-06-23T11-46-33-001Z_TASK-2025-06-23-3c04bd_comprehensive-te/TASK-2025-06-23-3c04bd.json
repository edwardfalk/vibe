  "description": "Create a comprehensive test suite for the ticketing system, covering all commands, access points (CLI, API, Browser), and both valid and invalid usage. Verify that error messages are clear and helpful. Also, review and update ALL documentation and rules related to the ticketing system to ensure they are 100% accurate and clear.",
  "comment": "Update: CLI stability is blocked. Exhaustive debugging reveals `ticket-cli.js` fails to execute under both `bun` and `node` runtimes. The failure is silent and appears to originate within the `parseArgs` function, preventing any part of the script from running. This is likely a runtime-specific bug in the current environment. The related PowerShell `PSReadLine` crash was also addressed by patching the profile script, but the core CLI execution failure persists. Further work on CLI testing is blocked until the runtime environment is stabilized after a system restart.",
