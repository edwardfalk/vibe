Title: Practical secrets scanning heuristics
Context: Deno-based scanner failed; naive long-string regex flagged commit SHAs and docs.
Policy:
  - Use Node-based scripts/scan-secrets.js.
  - Ignore: .env, .env.example, docs/**, docs-site/**, coderabbit-reviews/**, .cursor/**.
  - Ignore URLs, comments, and known safe vendor terms (Tone.js, raw.githubusercontent.com) when matching.
  - Prefer positive patterns (AWS keys, GitHub tokens) over length-only heuristics when possible.
Enforcement: CI uses scan:secrets; failures must identify files under packages/** or scripts/** only.
Scope: scripts/scan-secrets.js, CI
Rationale: Reduce false positives and keep focus on real leaks in code.
