# CodeRabbit Review Routine (Daily/Weekly)

<!-- desc: Make CodeRabbit reviews part of the natural workflow via CI + assistant habits. -->

ID: CR-ROUTINE-20250812-01
Title: Enforce daily/weekly CodeRabbit review routines
Context: Reviews are most useful when fetched and acted on continuously. We codify daily and weekly habits so the assistant always uses them.
Policy:
  - Daily (lightweight):
    - Use GitHub MCP tools to read open PRs, reviews, and comments; filter author `coderabbitai[bot]`.
    - Apply 1â€“2 safe fixes or open a tiny maintenance PR.
  - Weekly (lightweight):
    - Use MCP to scan for outstanding CodeRabbit items and batch non-urgent fixes into one PR.
  - Scope:
    - Only files that exist and live under `packages/**`, `scripts/**`, or `tests/**`.
    - Skip legacy or deleted paths.
Enforcement: Use GitHub MCP tools; do not add fetch/aggregation workflows. Auto-review workflow stays: `.github/workflows/coderabbit-review.yml`.
Scope: repo-wide
Rationale: Small, continuous fixes keep the codebase healthy and avoid backlog.
