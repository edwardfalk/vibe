Title: Stabilize test navigation and localize Tone.js imports
Context: Playwright probes intermittently failed on page.goto due to network imports and event timing. Also, a Deno-based secret scanner broke under bun/cmd.exe.
Policy:
  - Tests must use gotoIndex(page) helper (waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded') from tests/playwright.setup.js.
  - index.html must import Tone from local node_modules via import map: "tone": "/node_modules/tone/build/Tone.js".
  - Secret scanner must be Node-based and ignore docs/reviews/.env files; avoid flagging known-safe URLs.
Enforcement: scan:consistency ensures no direct page.goto(INDEX_PAGE) calls remain; CI runs test:orchestrated.
Scope: tests/**, index.html, scripts/scan-secrets.js
Rationale: Removes external flakiness, standardizes navigation, and makes scans reliable on Windows.
