# Vibe Rule Files (Docsify Copy)

**NOTE:** All `.mdc` files in this directory are automatically copied from `.cursor/rules/` by the rule index generation script (`scripts/generate-rule-index.js`).

- The authoritative versions of all rules are in `.cursor/rules/`.
- Any edits made here will be overwritten the next time the script runs.
- For up-to-date and editable rules, always use `.cursor/rules/`.

This directory exists only to allow Docsify to index and render the rules for documentation purposes.
