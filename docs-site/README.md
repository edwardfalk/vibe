# Vibe Documentation Site

Welcome to the web version of the Vibe docs. Use the sidebar to navigate.

* **Rule Index** – quick list of all coding/architecture rules.
* **Project Vision** – high-level design goals.
* **Architecture & Standards** – folder map, coding conventions.

These pages render the same markdown that lives in the repo. Rules are auto-mirrored from `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` to `docs-site/rules/` by the sync script run in `docs:serve`. PRs updating rules automatically improve the site.
