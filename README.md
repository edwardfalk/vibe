## Overview

Vibe is a rhythm-driven, modular space shooter where every action is synced to the cosmic beat. The beat is made with the beatClock. Sound effects, ambient noise and certain enemy actions happens with the beat. This is not something that should really be noticed when playing and controlling the player other than that the sounds together build the "music" in the game. The stabber, for example, is an enemy that tries to stab you with what from the beginning was a "laser knife" but now is more of a weird beak. The stabber makes a screech when attacking, but the game is made such that the stabber moves slowly near the player until he falls into the correct beat on 3.5 in the 4/4 beat where he can make his dissonant screech (all the other sounds harmonizes) and thereby syncopating the other sounds. Enememies with dark bass sounds act on beat 1 as bass drums, lighter punchy sounds fall in as snares, etc.

The main character is a bizarre mad action hero/antihero that walks around in the middle of outer space blasting aliens that are a strange mix of murderous psychopaths, whiny babies and bumbling idiots. At the same time. The grunts are the simplest enemies, they have a baby-like voice and asks for their mommy and what the password is for the wifi while attacking and trying to kill you. They shoot and try to keep their distance. The stabbers make eerie female psycho noises and make dashing attacks when near. You can dash away yourself or shoot to keep them back. The rushers .. rush. and try to blow themselves up as close to you as possible. The tanks are giants with armor that shoot giant plasma balls that goes straight through both enemies and the player killing them instantly. If you kill a tank they collapse into a plasma cloud that's not healthy at all to enter. If you manage to get close enough to one you place a nuclear time bomb on it and have 3 seconds to get the hell out of there. When the bomb explodes the tank together with the nuke forms a radioactive greenish plasma cloud with particles in it. That cloud is even worse. 

The player character fires quickly and makes a quarter note hihat beat. An idea to expand the game with is to have a shotgun power-up that fires more slowly, and you would get a damage bonus if you fire exactly on beat 1. If you keep the button pressed you could fire a little bit faster, but too get the damage bonus you would have to wait a moment longer and fire manually. 

 Built with **p5.js 1.7.0** in instance mode, the project emphasizes clean architecture, maintainability, and multi-AI model compatibility through strict consistency standards.

For the project's core vision, design pillars, and development philosophy, see [`docs/PROJECT_VISION.md`](./docs/PROJECT_VISION.md).

**Technology Stack:**

- **Engine**: p5.js 1.7.0 (migrated from Phaser for better modularity)
- **Architecture**: ES modules with strict dependency injection
- **Development**: MCP tools integration for advanced automation
- **Testing**: Probe-driven Playwright with automated bug reporting

The project features a robust ticketing system for all bugs, features, and enhancements, plus advanced MCP tools for memory management, automated testing, and file operations.

## Project Structure & Architecture

- **Strict modular architecture:** All new and modular code lives in `packages/` (`core`, `systems`, `entities`, `fx`, `tooling`).
- **No legacy/monolithic files:** Only use modular files listed in `.cursorrules` and under `packages/`.
- **js/** is for wrappers, glue, or legacy entry points only. Do not add new code to `js/`.
- **Core Systems:** See `packages/systems/` for main systems (GameLoop, GameState, CameraSystem, etc.)
- **Entities:** See `packages/entities/` for Player, BaseEnemy, Grunt, Rusher, Tank, Stabber, EnemyFactory, bullet, etc.
- **Support:** See `packages/core/` for Audio, BeatClock, visualEffects, effects, config, mathUtils, etc.
- **Other:** Ticketing, probes, and debug helpers are in `packages/tooling/`.
- **See `packages/` for the full, up-to-date list.**

> **Always consult the latest `.cursorrules` for the single source of truth on architecture, coding standards, and best practices.**

---

## Ticketing System

The project uses a robust REST API for all ticket management.

**API Quick Reference:**
- **List Tickets:** `GET /api/tickets`
- **Create Ticket:** `POST /api/tickets`
- **Get Ticket:** `GET /api/tickets/:id`
- **Update Ticket:** `PATCH /api/tickets/:id`
- **Delete Ticket:** `DELETE /api/tickets/:id`

For the full guide on API endpoints, parameters, and `curl` examples, see the [TICKETING_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md](docs/TICKETING_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md).

---

## Development & Testing

- **Dev server**: Five Server runs on port 5500 (`http://localhost:5500`).
- **Backend server**: Runs on port 3001 for ticket API and automation.
- **Start all servers with `bun run dev`** (kills ports 5500/3001 if needed).
- **Testing**: Only probe-driven Playwright tests are allowed (see `docs/MCP_PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_GUIDE.md`). Remove all manual `.spec.js` tests.
- **Test mode**: Press 'T' in-game to enable scripted testing.
- **Bug-report modal**: Open with 'B' + 'R' or UI button. Keyboard: Enter/Ctrl+Enter = Save, Escape = Cancel.
- **Artifacts**: All screenshots/logs saved in `tests/bug-reports/` and grouped by ticket ID.

---

## Coding Standards

- **Simplicity, readability, maintainability, testability, reusability.**
- **Multi-AI Model Compatibility**: Strict consistency standards ensure identical behavior across different AI models.
- Use ES modules (`import`/`export`) with mandatory dependency injection patterns.
- **p5.js Instance Mode**: All drawing functions must use `this.p.` prefix (e.g., `this.p.fill()`, `this.p.ellipse()`).
- Import math functions from `mathUtils.js` instead of using p5.js globals.
- **Constructor Signatures**: All enemy classes use exact signature: `constructor(x, y, type, config, p, audio)`.
- **Console Logging**: All logs must use emoji prefixes (üéÆ Game state, üéµ Audio, üó°Ô∏è Combat, etc.).
- **Timing System**: Use `deltaTimeMs` for frame-independent calculations, normalized to 60fps baseline.
- Use early returns, descriptive names, and clear error handling.
- All code must pass ESLint and Prettier before commit. Run `bun run lint` to check linting and `bun run format` to apply Prettier formatting.
- **See `.cursorrules` for complete standards and mandatory patterns.**

---

## Memory Management

- Uses a structured knowledge graph for entities, relations, and observations.
- See `.cursorrules` for workflow and best practices.

---

## Audio & Visuals

- Audio system is modular and beat-synced.
- Visual effects are triggered via a global event-bus system (`EnemyEventBus` + `VFXDispatcher`), ensuring all feedback is modular, testable, and balanced.
- See `docs/DESIGN.md` for a full diagram and explanation of the new VFX system.
- See `docs/AUDIO_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` for setup.

---

## Contributing

- **All changes must follow modular architecture and ticketing workflow.**
- Update `.cursorrules` and this README if architecture or standards change.
- See `.cursorrules` for rules on memory, testing, and coding standards.
