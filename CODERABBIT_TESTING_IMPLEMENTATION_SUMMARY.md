## 🔧 How It Works

### GitHub PR Comments Testing
1. **API Integration**: Connects to GitHub API to fetch PR comments
2. **Comment Analysis**: Filters for CodeRabbit-generated comments
3. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates comment relevance and accuracy
4. **Mock Data**: Provides fallback when GitHub token unavailable

### Local IDE Comments Testing
1. **File Scanning**: Searches code files for CodeRabbit comment markers
2. **Pattern Matching**: Detects various comment patterns:
   - `// 🤖 CodeRabbit:`
   - `// TODO: CodeRabbit`
   - `// @coderabbit`
3. **Extension Verification**: Checks if CodeRabbit VS Code extension is installed
4. **Real-time Simulation**: Tests comment overlay functionality

### Integration with Existing Systems
1. **MCP Playwright**: Can test real-time commenting in browser
2. **Ticketing System**: Auto-creates bug tickets for failed tests
3. **Probe Architecture**: Follows existing probe-driven testing patterns
4. **Automated Reporting**: Generates markdown reports like other test systems

## 🎯 Key Features

### Automated Detection
- **Extension Status**: Automatically detects if CodeRabbit extension is installed
- **GitHub Configuration**: Verifies GitHub workflow and token availability
- **Comment Markers**: Scans code files for existing CodeRabbit comments
- **API Functionality**: Tests integration with CodeRabbit analysis engine

### Quality Analysis
- **Accuracy Measurement**: Compares detected issues vs expected issues
- **Coverage Calculation**: Estimates percentage of code reviewed
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks response times and efficiency
