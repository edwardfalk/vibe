# üêõ Vibe Game Debugging Checklist

## Issues Found & Status

### ‚úÖ CLEAN - Test System
- [x] **No old .spec.js files** - Test structure is clean per .cursorrules
- [x] **Probe-driven tests only** - Following MCP Playwright guidelines
- [x] **Ticketing system active** - Custom system working, not broken

### ‚úÖ FIXED - Explosions System
- [x] **Effects re-enabled in GameLoop.js** - effectsManager now properly initialized
- [x] **Visual effects restored** - Full rendering active
- [x] **ExplosionManager integrated** - System present and ready
- [x] **Missing math functions added** - Added lerp and TWO_PI to mathUtils.js

### üîß PARTIALLY FIXED - Combat System  
- [x] **Player bullet direction fixed** - Fixed cos/sin imports in player.js
- [x] **Math function consistency** - Using mathUtils.js imports properly
- [ ] **No enemy deaths** - Still investigating collision detection
- [ ] **Shooting mechanism** - Need to verify bullet creation and firing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **New issue found** - Multiple pop() without push() warnings in effects

### ‚úÖ WORKING - Enemy System
- [x] **Enemy spawning functional** - 2 enemies active and shooting
- [x] **Enemy AI working** - Enemies moving and attacking player
- [x] **Enemy bullets hitting player** - Player taking damage correctly
- [x] **SpawnSystem operational** - New enemies spawning as expected

## üîß Fix Priority Order

### Priority 1: Re-enable Effects System
1. **Fix GameLoop.js** - Re-enable effectsManager initialization
2. **Test explosion triggers** - Verify explosions fire on enemy death
3. **Validate visual effects** - Ensure particles and screen effects work

### Priority 2: Fix Combat System
1. **Debug bullet direction** - Fix mouse aiming calculation
2. **Check collision detection** - Ensure bullets hit enemies
3. **Verify damage application** - Confirm enemy health decreases
4. **Test enemy death sequence** - Ensure proper cleanup and effects

### Priority 3: Enhanced Testing
1. **Create automated test** - Probe-driven combat validation
2. **Add debug logging** - Better visibility into combat flow
3. **Performance validation** - Ensure fixes don't break stability

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Enemies explode with visual effects when killed
- [ ] Player bullets aim toward mouse cursor correctly  
- [ ] Enemy health decreases when hit by bullets
- [ ] Explosion particles and screen shake work
- [ ] New enemies continue spawning after kills
- [ ] Game remains stable with effects enabled

## üìù Testing Notes

**Current State (2025-06-08 - After Fixes):**
- ‚úÖ Game loads and runs without crashes
- ‚úÖ Effects system re-enabled and functional
- ‚úÖ 2 enemies spawn and shoot at player
- ‚úÖ Player takes damage from enemy bullets
- ‚úÖ Math functions properly imported (cos, sin, lerp, TWO_PI)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Player shooting mechanism needs verification
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple pop() without push() warnings in effects rendering
- ‚ùå Enemy count still remains constant (no deaths confirmed)

**Test Environment:**
- Windows 11 + PowerShell 7 + Bun
- Five Server on http://localhost:5500
- MCP Playwright for automated testing
- Custom ticketing system for bug tracking
