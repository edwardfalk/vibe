# üêõ Vibe Game Debugging Checklist

## Issues Found & Status

### ‚úÖ CLEAN - Test System
- [x] **No old .spec.js files** - Test structure is clean per .cursorrules
- [x] **Probe-driven tests only** - Following MCP Playwright guidelines
- [x] **Ticketing system active** - Custom system working, not broken

### ‚úÖ FIXED - Explosions System
- [x] **Effects re-enabled in GameLoop.js** - effectsManager now properly initialized
- [x] **Visual effects restored** - Full rendering active
- [x] **ExplosionManager integrated** - System present and ready
- [x] **Missing math functions added** - Added lerp and TWO_PI to mathUtils.js

### üîß PARTIALLY FIXED - Combat System  
- [x] **Player bullet direction fixed** - Fixed cos/sin imports in player.js
- [x] **Math function consistency** - Using mathUtils.js imports properly
- [x] **Shooting mechanism working** - Player can shoot (timing needs adjustment)
- [ ] **No enemy deaths** - Still investigating collision detection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **New issue found** - Multiple pop() without push() warnings in effects
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BeatClock timing too restrictive** - Quarter-beat timing prevents responsive shooting

### ‚úÖ WORKING - Enemy System
- [x] **Enemy spawning functional** - 2 enemies active and shooting
- [x] **Enemy AI working** - Enemies moving and attacking player
- [x] **Enemy bullets hitting player** - Player taking damage correctly
- [x] **SpawnSystem operational** - New enemies spawning as expected

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED - CodeRabbit Reviews - 42 Total Tickets
- **30 Open tickets** remaining (down from 32)
- **12 Resolved tickets** (up from 10) 
- **Recently Closed Issues:**
  - ‚úÖ File removal issues: `js/coderabbit-game-debugger.js`, `mcp-automated-test-runner.js`
  - ‚úÖ Casing issues: `visualEffects.js` properly named
  - ‚úÖ Security issues: Undefined metadata access (file removed)
  - ‚úÖ Performance issues: Aggregate reducer problems (file removed)

**Remaining High Priority Issues:**
- **Bug**: Collision detection verification needed
- **Performance**: Optional chaining improvements in probe files  
- **Style**: CI workflow optimization
- **Testing**: Enhanced probe coverage and reliability

## üîß Fix Priority Order

### Priority 1: Fix Combat System
1. **Fix collision detection** - Ensure player bullets hit enemies
2. **Adjust BeatClock timing** - Make shooting more responsive
3. **Fix pop() without push() warnings** - Clean up effects rendering
4. **Test enemy death sequence** - Ensure proper cleanup and effects

### Priority 2: Address Remaining CodeRabbit Issues (30 open)
1. **Bug fixes** - Collision detection, optional chaining improvements
2. **Performance optimizations** - Probe file enhancements
3. **Testing improvements** - Enhanced coverage and reliability
4. **Style fixes** - CI workflow optimization

### Priority 3: Enhanced Testing
1. **Create automated test** - Probe-driven combat validation
2. **Add debug logging** - Better visibility into combat flow
3. **Performance validation** - Ensure fixes don't break stability

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Enemies explode with visual effects when killed
- [ ] Player bullets hit enemies and reduce their health
- [ ] Enemy health decreases when hit by bullets
- [ ] Explosion particles and screen shake work
- [ ] New enemies continue spawning after kills
- [ ] Game remains stable with effects enabled
- [x] CodeRabbit file-removal issues resolved (12 tickets closed)
- [ ] Remaining 30 CodeRabbit tickets addressed
- [ ] No more pop() without push() warnings

## üìù Testing Notes
